# The Vision for Teres

## Main Role

The main role for teres is:

- Manipulate framerates to both increase and decrease framerate of a video
- Provide a utility that can blend frames together
- Be as un-opinionated (in api and config) as possible so integration into workflows and maybe other processes be as easy as it can

While these are the main principles for development they are not strict especially if they in the future are conflicting

## Goals

While this is not going to be an enterprise grade software there are some goals that would be great to hit in its development

- Have a visually appealing frontend
- Have control over the entire workflow of interpolating and encoding
- Have support for all platforms and be easily installed
